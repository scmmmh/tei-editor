The TEI editor is built using Vue.js and can be used both as a stand-alone application and as a component
to be loaded within another Vue.js application.

It provides the following features:

* Fully visual editing of text (no XML or TEI in sight)

  * Support for multiple text editors within a single TEI document (text, aparatus, ...)
  * Support for nested documents (footnotes, annotations, ...)

* Editing of the TEI header metadata
