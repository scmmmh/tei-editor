TEI Editor
##########

The TEI Editor is a JavaScript web-application that provides a WYSTYG (What You See, TEI You Get) editor for editing
TEI documents. It provides a modern user-interface that supports the creation of complex TEI documents without manual
XML editing. However, it also imposes certain restrictions on the TEI, which mean that it may not be applicable for
all TEI files that are out there (and that is not the aim, either).
